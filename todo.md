# Things to do
- Keep current model architecture
- Add more metrics (we will need more for a complicated dataset)
    - accuracy, precision, recall, AUC
- Keep the same dataset and have 3 approaches for feature extraction
    - Use different feature extraction techniques
- Switch to more complicated techniqu after the ideal method is ironed out
